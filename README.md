# kernel
This is a personal experiment: an attempt to build a kernel from scratch.

The goal isn't to make something fully functional or even correctâ€”it's just a way for me to apply what I'm learning in hardware-related subjects. Think of it as a learning sandbox.

Don't expect much (yet), but feel free to poke around!
